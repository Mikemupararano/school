# MT Online School


This portfolio shows solid examples of my dedication and work over time. I worked incredibly hard to design a website for my online tutoring. 

I teach GCSE Maths, and all the sciences plus A level Sciences and Mathematics. The lessons are online via zoom. I have selected this work as it showcases my skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in website designs.



To assemble this portfolio, I created the framework using HTML, a little bit of CSS and the rest using Bootstrap 5. 

The project was work hours and days of hard work and dedication to research information and apply some solutions. I would get stuck on every step of the work but resorting to research always yielded the solution. I read the Bootstrap library extensively and apply some templates, cards and code to suit the customer specifications. On average, I slept at 2am!

I used the following web-links for research and support:
(1) For CSS code and bootstrap code links: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
(2) Bootstrap 5 icons: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
(3) I used the templates from this link to create tables and columns for my contact me section; https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#how-they-work
(4) For the grid, in the work section, I used these templates: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#example
(5) The cards were designed using the following templates from this page: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#about
(6) The following stack overflow link was useful in informing me how to add the images to github and answered several of my questions on adding features to cards: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23596369/how-to-upload-images-like-png-into-github-repository
(7) I had watched the following video and even created my own online school website using bootstrap and the ideas on this video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s.
